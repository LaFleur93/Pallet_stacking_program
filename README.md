# Pallet stacking program: Positioning of production pallets according to heights in a storage room (real-life problem)
<h2>About</h2>

This program intends to stack pallets filled up with different amounts of boxes in the best way possible. There are, however, some restrictions to overcome.

<h3>Background and restrictions</h3>

There are two types of production processes involved, with two different types of boxes: Trayseal (TS) and Flowpack (FP), which should be stored in two storage rooms for two different locations (Brøndby and Hasselager). The pallets, depeding on the amount of boxes on them, can end up being "flat" or "non-flat" pallets. The "non-flat" pallets are those which no more pallets can be put on top.

There are some other restrictions, including the height of the door of the storage room (the pile of pallets should not be higher than the door height), and the number of positions in the storage rooms (maximum 6 positions).

<h3>Use of program</h3>

The input cells for the amount of boxes are located on the left of the screen. There is a button to generate each pallet distribution. The results are shown on the right screen, with the Trayseal pallets being in red color and the Flowpack pallets in blue.

Based on these distributions, the employer is able to position the pallets in the storage room (Brøndby in the example below):
